# Restaurant-Page-TOP
A simple, dynamically-rendered restaurant homepage that uses JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website. 

### Pre-Project 
- For this project, I will be furthering my practice with using DOM manipulation for creating this simple page. 
- I will also be trying to implement newly learned methods of JS organization by using ES6 classes and importing/exporting modules as packages.
- I will be getting my hands wet with using node, specifically webpack for code bundling. 
- HTML and CSS skills will naturally be exercised from this project.

### Post-Project
- This project has given me a lot of useful experience using webpack to bundle my assets such as multiple JavaScript files and CSS stylesheet.
- Other webpack experience included utilizing tools such as watch mode and webpack-dev-server to help with automatic compiling, as well as source maps to help with debugging.
- Used HtmlWebpackPlugin to help manage the output of multiple bundles from files using different names. 
- Import/Export was used and I am now familiar with applying SOLID principles to my JavaScript programs and creating multiple smaller files with single responsibilities, then connecting into a single program using the ES6 export keyword.
- Rendering files using only JavaScript was more difficult than I thought it would be, but once I figured out how to do the home page, the others were simple enough to complete using a similar formula. 
- It was fun using JavaScript code to create functions that dynamically render the food items on the menu rather than hardcoding each item individually. Getting a taste of backend development.
