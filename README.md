# Restaurant-Page-TOP
A simple, dynamically-rendered restaurant homepage that uses JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website. 

### Pre-Project 
- For this project, I will be furthering my practice with using DOM manipulation for creating this simple page. 
- I will also be trying to implement newly learned methods of JS organization by using ES6 classes and importing/exporting modules as packages.
- I will be getting my hands wet with using node, specifically webpack for code bundling. 
- HTML and CSS skills will naturally be exercised from this project.
